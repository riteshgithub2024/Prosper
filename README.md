Well Design and Analysis:

1. Well Design and Placement:
   - Utilize deviation survey data to design various well configurations.
   - Employ well editor tools to position pressure nodes, valves, and casings within the system.

2. PVT Properties and Wax Analysis:
   - Generate PVT properties and wax precipitation curves.
   - Calculate the Wax Appearance Temperature (WAT) of crude oil using Multiflash.
   - Calculate wax deposition on the well walls.
   - Identify changes in flow regime over time and along the pipe length.

3. IPR and TPR Curve Generation and Analysis:
   - Generate Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) and Tubing Performance Relationship (TPR) curves using Darcy, Fetkovich, and Vogel models.
   - Analyze the effect of changes in Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR), tubing diameter, and water cut on the IPR and TPR curves.
   - Calculate the operating point from the intersection of IPR and TPR curves.
   - Optimize the operating point using an operational envelope.
